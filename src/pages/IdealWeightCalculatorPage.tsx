                                Ideal weight is the body weight considered appropriate for maintaining a healthy life based on a person's age, height, gender, and body type. Each person's ideal weight can vary because it depends on body composition and metabolic rate. For example, a person with more muscle mass may have a higher ideal weight than someone with less muscle mass.

                        How to Calculate Ideal Weight?
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography paragraph style={{ color: 'black' }}>
                        Ideal weight can be calculated using several methods. Some of these include:
                    </Typography>
                    <ul style={{ color: 'black' }}>
                        <li>Body Mass Index (BMI): A widely used method that uses height and weight to estimate ideal body weight.</li>
                        <li>Hamwi Formula: A formula that estimates ideal body weight based on height and gender.</li>
                        <li>Devine Formula: Similar to the Hamwi formula but slightly modified for better accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <Typography paragraph style={{ color: 'black' }}>
                        Using these formulas, you can estimate your ideal weight. For example, the Hamwi formula for men is: Ideal weight (kg) = 48 + 2.7 * (height (cm) - 152). For women, it is: Ideal weight (kg) = 45.5 + 2.2 * (height (cm) - 152).

                        Maintaining an ideal weight is crucial for overall health. It helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improves physical performance, and enhances mental well-being. By staying within the ideal weight range, you can ensure a healthier and more active lifestyle.
